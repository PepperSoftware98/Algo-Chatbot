# Algo-Chatbot
A simple, algorithmic, resource-efficient and locally run chatbot that can perform basic tasks that will work for most people, such as writing, code, ideas, math, and more. This will consume less resources and be cheaper than traditional llms/ai bots, but may work for a lot of people.
